![demo (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7ec122-274d-4f6e-b00e-7f352a6819fc)

DevCrew is a platform designed to connect developers for hackathons. Our platform simplifies the process of finding teammates with complementary skills, joining existing teams, and showcasing your work to potential collaborators.

## üåü Key Features

### Proof of Work (POW) System - Our MVP ‚ú®

The centerpiece of DevCrew is our innovative **Proof of Work (POW)** system, which allows developers to showcase their skills through actual work samples rather than just listing technologies they know.

- **Multi-platform Integration**: Seamlessly embed content from:
  - **Twitter/X**: Display actual tweets with engagement metrics
  - **LinkedIn**: Link to professional posts and updates
  - **GitHub**: Showcase repositories with stars, forks, and language information

- **Rich Content Display**: Each POW item shows:
  - Custom descriptions to provide context
  - Platform-specific styling and information
  - Interactive elements for direct engagement

- **Searchable Portfolio**: Your POWs create a living portfolio that other users can discover through search

POW Feature profiles with skills, interests, and achievements
